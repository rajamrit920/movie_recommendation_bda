# üé¨ Movie Recommendation System  

## üìå Project Overview  
The **Movie Recommendation System** is designed to provide personalized movie suggestions using a **hybrid approach** that combines **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering**. By leveraging **Big Data Analytics** tools like **PySpark**, this system efficiently processes large-scale movie datasets, enabling faster and more accurate recommendations. The primary goal of this project is to overcome the common limitations of traditional recommendation techniques, such as the **cold start problem** and **data sparsity issues**, by integrating multiple filtering methods. The hybrid approach ensures that users receive **relevant, diverse, and engaging movie recommendations** based on both their past interactions and the content similarities of movies.  

## üöÄ Features  
This project incorporates several advanced features to enhance the recommendation process. The **Hybrid Recommendation System** blends Collaborative Filtering, which understands user preferences based on interactions, with **Content-Based Filtering**, which analyzes movie metadata to identify similar films. It also utilizes **Big Data Processing** through **PySpark**, ensuring scalability for handling vast datasets. **Movie Similarity Computation** is achieved using **TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity**, allowing the system to generate meaningful content-based recommendations. Furthermore, **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** is implemented to build a robust Collaborative Filtering model, improving the accuracy of suggestions. The entire system is structured as a **Scalable Machine Learning Pipeline**, making it adaptable for large-scale deployments.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
The project is built using **Python** as the core programming language, with **PySpark** serving as the primary **Big Data framework** for handling large-scale computations efficiently. The **machine learning models** implemented include **ALS for Collaborative Filtering** and **TF-IDF with CountVectorizer for Content-Based Filtering**. Data processing is conducted using **Pandas and NumPy**, while **Matplotlib and Seaborn** are used for visualization purposes. Version control is managed through **Git**, ensuring seamless collaboration and code management. The system is designed with modularity, allowing easy integration with **Flask or Streamlit** for web-based deployment in the future.  

## üìÇ Dataset  
The project utilizes data from the **MovieLens** dataset, which is widely used for recommendation system research. It consists of two key components: the **Movies Dataset**, containing attributes such as `movieId`, `title`, and `genres`, and the **Ratings Dataset**, which includes `userId`, `movieId`, and `rating` values. These datasets are preprocessed to remove inconsistencies, normalize text fields, and generate structured feature vectors for recommendation. The **Movies Dataset** helps extract content-based features like **genres and TF-IDF scores**, while the **Ratings Dataset** enables **user preference modeling** for collaborative filtering. By combining both datasets, the system ensures that recommendations are both **personalized and diverse**.  

## üî• Model Performance  
The **Collaborative Filtering model**, powered by **ALS**, predicts user preferences based on past ratings and similar user behaviors. The **Content-Based Filtering approach** utilizes **TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity** to recommend movies that share textual or categorical similarities. Finally, the **Hybrid Model** combines both methods, producing superior recommendations compared to standalone approaches. The system achieves high accuracy in ranking movie suggestions by adjusting the weight of collaborative and content-based scores. Additionally, **evaluation metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and correlation heatmaps** are used to assess the model‚Äôs effectiveness, confirming its ability to provide **highly relevant movie recommendations**.  

## üìä Results and Observations  
The **hybrid approach** significantly improves recommendation accuracy compared to traditional methods. The **top 10 hybrid recommendations** are displayed for each user, showcasing the combined effectiveness of collaborative and content-based techniques. Additionally, **content-based recommendations** provide a list of movies that closely match a given film‚Äôs genre, title, or description. A **correlation heatmap** is generated to compare actual vs. predicted ratings, revealing strong alignment in user preferences. The system‚Äôs **RMSE score of 0.81267** indicates a high level of prediction accuracy. The **most recommended movies** include films with consistently high ratings across multiple users, demonstrating the model‚Äôs ability to capture **popular and user-specific preferences** effectively.  

## üìå Future Enhancements  
The current system is designed for **batch processing**, but future enhancements can incorporate **real-time recommendations** by integrating **Apache Kafka** for streaming data. Additionally, **Deep Learning techniques**, such as **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)**, can further refine predictions. Deployment as a **fully interactive web application** using Flask or Streamlit is another goal, making the system **accessible to users worldwide**. Other improvements include **API integration with real-time movie databases**, such as IMDb or TMDb, to provide the latest movie recommendations.
